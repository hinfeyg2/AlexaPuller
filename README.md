ReelID-Copier
=============

For use in the Film/Television Post Production industry.

Python program to allow video files to be copied from an EDL.
It scans the EDL for the reel ID column.
Then it adds user entered filenames.
It searchs multiple drives for a file named reelID+ext eg: A065C009_121119_R3H0.mov.
It then scans the destination directory to make sure the files do not already exist at that location.
If they dont the program will copy the files.
